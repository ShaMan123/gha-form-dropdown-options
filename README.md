A github action populating options for an [issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) dropdown.

## Looking for a _Version_ dropdown?

Checkout [![issue-forms-version-dropdown](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/ShaMan123/gha-populate-form-version?label=ShaMan123%2Fgha-populate-form-version%40&sort=semver)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issue-forms-version-dropdown)

## Configuring

Follow [this workflow](.github/workflows/update_bug_report.yml).\
Replace the `uses: ./` directive to point to [![published action](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/ShaMan123/gha-form-dropdown-options?label=ShaMan123%2Fgha-form-dropdown-options%40&sort=semver)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issue-forms-dropdown-options).

Refer to the `inputs` and `outputs` definitions in the [spec](action.yml).

## Using a Template

The `template` option introduces a _build_ step, sort of speaking.

The action will use the `template` to build the form as follows:

- Static dropdowns (dropdowns with populated options in the template) take precedence over their built counterpart,
  assuming that a dropdown with empty options will be handled by an action.
  See an example [commit](https://github.com/ShaMan123/gha-form-dropdown-options/pull/2/commits/7cbd904caccb60c9bf52f066d11b303e439fe598).
- Dynamic dropdowns are persisted in order to enable updating a form from multiple runs.
- Update the inputted dropdown

This means that you shouldn't edit the built form ever, as you wouldn't edit a build file.

This behavior makes sense but could have been handled with ease if flagging dynamic dropdowns in forms was possible.
It might change to a stricter approach in the future using id prefixing.

Using a `template` is **suggested** for the following:

- Preserving comments: Parsing the yaml file will loose all comments
- DX: Maintaining forms with long dropdown options

It is suggested using the template option once, in the first step updating the form, and omitting it afterwards.

Take a look at the [template file](./.github/template_report.yml) used to generate the [built file](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/long_report.yml) ad refer to [Live](#live).

## Conflicting Runs

Since workflows run in concurrency you may encounter a case in which a number of runs are trying to modify and commit the same file.\
This might result in a merge conflict.\
If that is the case the action will fail.

_Consider the following:_\
The labels of this repo are populated into a dropdown (see [Live](#live)).\
Modifying a label more than once in a short period of time (before the previous runs completed) will fail to update the form.

Consider handling failures in a consequent step or use the `dry_run` option to prevent the action from trying to commit in the first place and handle that yourself.

## Creating a PR

Consider using [![create-pull-request](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/peter-evans/create-pull-request?label=peter-evans%2Fcreate-pull-request&sort=semver)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/create-pull-request) in order to commit changes in an orderly and safe fashion to a generate PR.

Refer to the `update-long-report` job in [this workflow](.github/workflows/update_bug_report.yml) to see a usage example and to [PR #5](../../pull/5).\
Don't forget to use the `dry_run` option.

## Live

This repo uses the action it defines ðŸš€.\
Take a look at the dropdowns populated into the [issue template](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) using [this workflow](.github/workflows/update_bug_report.yml).
