A github action populating options for an [issue forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) dropdown.

## Looking for a _Version_ dropdown?

Checkout [![issue-forms-version-dropdown](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/ShaMan123/gha-populate-form-version?label=ShaMan123%2Fgha-populate-form-version%40&sort=semver)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issue-forms-version-dropdown)

## Configuring

Follow [this workflow](.github/workflows/update_bug_report.yml).\
Replace the `uses: ./` directive to point to [![published action](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/ShaMan123/gha-form-dropdown-options?label=ShaMan123%2Fgha-form-dropdown-options%40&sort=semver)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issue-forms-dropdown-options).

Refer to the `inputs` and `outputs` definitions in the [spec](action.yml).

## Conflicting Runs

Since workflows run in concurrency you may encounter a case in which a number of runs are trying to modify and commit the same file.\
This might result in a merge conflict.\
If that is the case the action will fail.

_Consider the following:_\
The labels of this repo are populated into a dropdown (see [Live](#live)).\
Modifying a label more than once in a short period of time (before the previous runs completed) will fail to update the form.

Consider handling failures in a consequent step or use the `dry_run` option to prevent the action from trying to commit in the first place and handle that yourself.

## Live

This repo uses the action it defines ðŸš€.\
Take a look at the dropdowns populated into the [issue template](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.yml) using [this workflow](.github/workflows/update_bug_report.yml).
